            Times are quickly falling apart.

            Distractions are all over the place.
            
            Dear Teen, do not forget That you have a DESTINY to fulfill..
            
            Nothing is worth trading your focus for, your discipline and diligence to finding and fulfilling purpose .
            
            Remember that, EVERYTHING YOU DO, MUST GLORIFY GOD.
            
            Wether you sing, eat, act, speak, play, all must GLORIFY GOD!
            
            
            FLEE EVERY APPEARANCE OF DISTRACTION, IT IS EVIL!
            
            
            This morning, DECIDE again to redirect your focus to the things that matters.
            
            You need help, guidance, my inbox is ever open!
