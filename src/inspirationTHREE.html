            <p>A man born of the spirit is invincible.
            Why? Because the spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in us, according to Romans 8:11.</p> <br>
            <p> No matter what comes our way, we can overcome it by the Spirit of God.
            Delay, struggles? We are more than conquerors.</p> <br>
            <p>The Holy Spirit can be everything to us, that we need.
            There is never a time that we are left alone. God lives in us, always!</p> <br>
            <p>His consciousness must not depart from us, we must keep it alive by *constant meditation* on God's Word.
                There's a transformation that happens when we constantly meditate on His Word, it is from Glory to GloryüíÉüèª</p> <br>
            <p>As you meditate, you fellowship!
            As you fellowship, you're transformed!</p> <br>
