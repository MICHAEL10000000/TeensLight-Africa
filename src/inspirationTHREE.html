            A man born of the spirit is invincible.
Why? Because the spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in us, according to Romans 8:11.

No matter what comes our way, we can overcome it by the Spirit of God.
Delay, struggles? We are more than conquerors.

The Holy Spirit can be everything to us, that we need.
There is never a time that we are left alone. God lives in us, always!

This consciousness must not depart from us, we must keep it alive by *constant meditation* on God's Word.

There's a transformation that happens when we constantly meditate on His Word, it is from *Glory to Glory*üíÉüèª

As you meditate, you fellowship!
As you fellowship, you're transformed!

*God is within you!*
