            <p>My Thought this morning is simple</p>
            <p> Don't give up on your dreams, even when the road ahead seems uncertain. Keep pushing forward, and know that every step closer to your goal is a step away from the doubts that held you back.</p>
            <p>You are stronger than you think, braver than you feel, and capable of more than you imagine. So hold your head high, let your heart be filled with hope, and remember that a brighter tomorrow is just a night's rest away.</p>
            <p> Always remember that every great achievement started with a small step, every great triumph began with a single decision, and every great success story was written with perseverance and determination.</p>
            <p>So dream big, dream bold, and dream with faith. God is not afraid of your dreams and he's working out his plan for your life, and in the light of dawn, His promises will unfold.</p>
            <p>God is always working everything out for your good.</p>
            <p>Hope you're blessed?</p>
